[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Welcome to the DezBet Docs And WhitePaper.","The gambling industry has been around for a long time. Those who have experienced it can vouch that at one point or another, thoughts about rigged games and unfair playing conditions were muddying up their thoughts. In situations such as this one, the virtues of on-chain implementations of monetary protocols cannot be overstated. Approaching this industry from a fresh, decentralized standpoint allows everyone to be equal. The house cannot always win, if there is no house. One could argue that we are all just addresses on the blockchain which spans across the globe. DezBet aims to provide a inexpensive, transparent and open source protocol, which will provide entertainment to anyone with a pair of private keys and an internet connection. Times are changing, and we must change with them."]}],[{"i":"2-the-gambling-industry---a-brief-history","l":"2. The gambling industry - A brief history","p":["Gambling has taken place, in some form or other, for hundreds if not thousands of years, and is inextricably linked to the history of humanity. From ancient China where indications of rudimentary games of chance were discovered on tiles, to Egypt where the oldest known dice were excavated, to scenes on Greek and Roman pottery, humans love to gamble and do so at every opportunity. Around 200 BC „white pigeon ticket“ was played in gambling houses of China with the permission of the province governor, who would receive a percentage of the profits, and the winnings were used to fund state works; Even Harvard and Yale were both initially funded using lottery money, which they continue to use today. As gambling spread throughout society it became more organized and regulated.","The mechanization of gambling meant that winnings could then be regulated more accurately. Today, one of the oldest industries in the world, has become one of the most strictly regulated ones. The ownership of casino entertainment facilities have become subject to pervasive regulations under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Gaming laws are based upon declarations of public policy designed to ensure that gaming is conducted honestly, competitively and free of criminal and corruptive elements. Since the continued growth and success of gaming is dependent upon public confidence, gaming laws protect gaming consumers and the integrity and vitality of the gaming industry, including prevention of fraudulent practices. Gaming laws are also designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxation and licensing fees imposed on gaming industry participants and enhance economic development and tourism.","To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws have established many procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character, fitness or suitability. These far-reaching and decisive government regulations around the world have forced the casino industry into long-term stagnation and massively impaired growth. This, now narrowed role of the casino, has stimulated innovation and ideas, which is why casinos are facing an unprecedented leap in development - a profound digitalisation and decentralisation of gaming transactions."]}],[{"i":"3-the-future---gambling-on-the-blockchain","l":"3. The Future - Gambling on the Blockchain","p":["Blockchain technology and the emergence of cryptocurrencies is disrupting the gambling industry in ways even experts could not have imagined. Using cryptocurrencies for gambling is becoming widely popular for casinos and can be used either as the main payment system, or as an alternative to fiat-based payment systems. The blockchain provides transaction transparency, reduced house edge and lowers transaction costs. The Blockchain also allows the user to gamble transparently and with the highest level of privacy, almost instantaneous withdrawal and deposit times, with no need to hand over copies of documents or even create an account. Blockchain technology brings this same attributes to gambling, allowing anyone to be a member of the casino. Although some Bitcoin casinos allow users to fund the casinos and profit from a share of the house edge, these concepts have been taken to the next level by other crypto platforms, where projects have created a system where token holders receive dividends from the profits generated by the platform.","Developments in this space are likely to grow rapidly, with teams of developers introducing opportunities for gambling utilizing blockchain technology. The most recent development: DezBet, a blockchain based gaming ecosystem that offers gambling applications with zero-house edge, competitive platform fees and true random numbers from the Chainlink VRF Oracle."]}],[{"l":"4. Market Analysis","p":["In 2020 the global iGaming market accrued USD 66.9 billion in revenues, with projections indicating that it will rise to USD 93 billion in 2023. The industry shows a significant growth rate of a little under 11.5% a year. Naturally such a high-valued online market that greatly hinges on constant monetary transfers for the intention of wagering attract ideas related to cryptocurrency transactions and blockchain functionalities.","iGaming is on an unprecedented upswing, with a compound annual growth rate of 11.49%, which is set to exceed the USD 100 billion mark by 2026. The industry is best developed in the northern hemisphere, with global market sizes reflecting current economic divisions around the globe. Europe represents the most prominent current market, with Northern America growing the fastest, explained by recent legalisation efforts within the US and Canada. iGaming saw its most recent boom during the COVID-19 pandemic. The temporary closure of physical venues redirected most consumers to the online environment. The influx of new users brought in considerably more revenue and changed the dynamic of gambling globally. This recent popularity was doubled by a move towards the mobile environment, with many essential operators developing dedicated apps and platforms for handheld devices. The Gambling Commission reports that mobile devices have become the most popular means of accessing online casinos and betting services, with around 50% of users using smartphones for this. Online gambling also adopts several emerging technologies to ensure steady growth and ongoing attraction towards the online consumer.","The e-sports scene saw an early adoption, with multiple betting services now providing staking options. Virtual sports are a similar option, but one that has a long history within the online gambling industry. Within the same vein, bookmakers started providing extended functionalities, including social betting, transfers between players and various player-to-player systems. The social aspect of gambling has become a key concept. One of the newest changes to the iGaming environment is the entry of cryptocurrency transactions onto platforms. This aspect creates some of the most remarkable changes to gambling sites and their potential future."]}],[{"i":"5--dezbet---decentralized-betting","l":"5. DezBet - Decentralized Betting","p":["DezBet is not just another gambling company. Our intent is not to create a company or an online platform through which we will act as a house. In fact, we are stepping away from that role completely. A blockchain protocol is being developed that will enable players to match up directly with one another. This way, all DezBet users will be on an equal footing. Using a cost-effective, highly efficient blockchain – to be announced – we are making it affordable for our players to execute smart contracts that create and manage the games between one another. Dezbet neither takes a share of the gambling profits, nor engages in any gambling rounds. We merely provide the smart contracts and the means to process them and charge a simple fee for hosting games. Consequently users don’t have to worry about losing money to the house, as the house is not involved in the betting.","As a decentralised gambling protocol, DezBet is not the opponent in the way that traditional casinos and blockchain gambling platforms are. We are on the players’ side, providing all of our users with the same fair chance at winning against each other. We are strictly on the outside of every bet. This is so that the players can take on all of the risk and partake in all of the winnings. A secure, transparent, P2P protocol for games of chance, DezBet will carry gambling into the modern era. We are shaking off the limitations of traditional casinos. We equip players with the tools to examine, test, and verify any game at any time.","We will use a VRF (Verifiable randomness function) to ensure all of our games are completely up to chance, build in measures to completely remove any prospect of fraud and ensure that no one can meddle with the odds. Thus users can completely trust the platform."]}],[{"i":"6-games-mvp","l":"6. Games (MVP)","p":["DezBet will support conventional casino games over time, which will operate in a decentralized manner. DezBet will also host a variety of slots, table games, lotteries, and similar games. The main focus will be on the games that are already popular, developing a handful of own DezBet games as well, in order to attract players who are looking for something new and unique. Note that because we are taking on none of the risk associated with the bets, there is never any possibility that DezBet will encounter liquidity problems. We are not taking any of the funds that become winnings for the players. Instead we connect players P2P meaning they act as their own bank generating on demand liquidity. To get started, players simply initiate a game on the blockchain. They make an initial request to the network, while the game initiates the functions required, such as the verifiable randomness function (VRF). While processing the game, DezBet will refer to a data feed known as an oracle. This is the trusted source of information that communicates the outcome of the game so that the smart contracts can be executed based on the external conditions of the game.","This is a medium paced game. The chance of winning is 1 /x, X E[1, 100], and the winnings will total y · [x], y being the bet amount minus fees. Each player will select a number between one and hundre(each number available for selection only once), and after there are 100 players in the game or timer runs out, an algorithm chooses the winning number at random, from only the numbers that the players have selected.","This is another medium-paced game. The chance of winning: \\frac{y}{x}, where x is the total jackpot value and y is the bet value, and the winnings will be the sum of all jackpot entries. It will function similarly to other jackpot games and progressive slot machines, enabling the player to win NFTs of both high and low values. The player will choose the number of NFTs or units to bet – the value staked determining the value that is available to win – and a VRF to initiate the game. The VRF selects the winner. Players' odds remain the same, however, not changing with the amount of the bet. The entire jackpot is available to win at any time.","This is a fast-paced game. The chance of winning: P(ChosenSide) = P(CS) = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\%, and the winnings will total 2x of the amount bet. It is a familiar game, played by two people, in which each player gets one half of the odds. The VRF then chooses the winning half of the bet. It is a winner-take-all game.","This is a medium-paced game. The chance of winning is \\frac{16!}{(16-5)!} , \\frac{24!}{(24-5)!}, 5\\frac{32!}{(32-5)!}, and the winning total is the sum of the entries. Unlike other lotteries, which take place on a schedule, this lottery will take place whenever the first player buys a ticket. The contract then begins a timer, after which the VRF will determine the winner. Because there is no lottery authority, the winner gets everything, minus the nominal DezBet fee. If no one wins the jackpot, then it rolls over into the next lottery."]}],[{"l":"7. Security and Safety","p":["The blockchain technology allows the transaction-recording that users make through cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Additionally, these transactions are maintained by several computers. This technology has a decentralized network that helps to track cryptocurrency transactions in a public ledger. In a single network, the system can record transactions securely on many computers. Due to its decentralized structure it promotes security and privacy. Cryptocurrencies are empowering the gambling industry. Many betting platforms and online casinos are turning to blockchain technology and embracing its potential. Their empowering qualities include the transparency of gambling records which are now difficult to alter. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are precious. Moreover, they are not under the control of a centralized body like the government. Cryptography records every gambler‘s details and ensures that they remain anonymous when transacting in cryptocurrency. Equally important, a public ledger/ blockchain updates all transactions made by currency holders. Every bitcoin goes directly to the public ledger which enhances transparency and protects the gamblers. Therefore, a crypto wallet is essential whilst playing in online casinos so digital tokens can be stored. A play can only be started upon transferring a number of bitcoins or any other currency to the player‘s account","Before the emergence of blockchain technology, a myriad of challenges has been plaguing the online gambling industry. Threats included, but were not limited to, fairness and security. As a result, blockchain has proved itself vital. This is because it addresses the problems that gamblers are facing.","Transparency Currently, online casinos are difficult to run as most gamblers lose their bets and claim the system is unfair. They accuse the system of setting them up for loss. Also, gambling is illegal in some countries. Therefore, financial institutions like banks will not offer gamblers loans. Contrary to this, blockchain is open and avails every transaction in the public domain. Therefore, everyone can see the winner, or loser, the amount won and whether the winner received the money.","Security Currently, online casinos are difficult to run as most gamblers lose their bets and claim the system is unfair.

Bitcoin addresses this well. Transactions involving bitcoin and other cryptos usually expel the intermediaries and documents. This simplifies and speeds up the payout process.","Anonymity Blockchain keeps the gambler‘s information private. Thus preventing the operators from identifying players on their platforms. Furthermore, this system is perfect for keeping away third parties from accessing the gamblers‘ data.","Efficiency and Access Cryptocurrency allows a smooth process by only needing email addresses and usernames.
