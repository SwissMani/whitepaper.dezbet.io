[[{"l":"Welcome","p":["Welcome to the DezBet Docs And WhitePaper.","The gambling industry has been around for a long time. Those who have experienced it can vouch that at one point or another, thoughts about rigged games and unfair playing conditions were muddying up their thoughts. In situations such as this one, the virtues of on-chain implementations of monetary protocols cannot be overstated. Approaching this industry from a fresh, decentralized standpoint allows everyone to be equal. The house cannot always win, if there is no house. One could argue that we are all just addresses on the blockchain which spans across the globe. DezBet aims to provide a inexpensive, transparent and open source protocol, which will provide entertainment to anyone with a pair of private keys and an internet connection. Times are changing, and we must change with them."]}],[{"l":"DezBet Whitepaper","p":["As a decentralised gambling protocol, DezBet is not the enemy like traditional casinos and blockchain gambling platforms are. Dezbet does not take a cut of gambling winnings, nor does it participate in gambling rounds. We simply provide the smart contracts and the means to process them, with a simple fee for providing the games. In this whitepaper, we dive into the explanation of our project."]}],[{"l":"1. Blockchain and Gambling Today","p":["Gambling, one of the world's oldest industries, also remains one of the most strictly regulated. Few other industries have faced the restrictions or the stigmas that have prevented gambling from expanding to the degree that it otherwise would. In many countries, online gambling is still a matter of debate. Powerful corporations have worked to keep the business confined in the United States and China, knowing that without the impediments their local laws put on the business, they would not be able to drive the profits they have driven or operate with the impunity they have.","Blockchain offers something that none of us have ever seen before: a way forward, out of the punitive and restrictive laws that have affected gambling for such a long time. For the first time ever, it is possible to envision a gambling industry that is substantially more independent from the corporations and the legislators who have protected it. We can picture a gambling industry that works outside of all that negative influence, putting the players in control of their experiences.","The decentralisation that blockchain facilitates enables blockchain gambling to function without any central authorities. There is no need for a “house,” because blockchain technology handles all of those roles. Fairness and transparency is guaranteed through decentralised processing, eliminating the need for dealers who are employed by and work for gambling companies. Everyone involved in a round or a game is on an equal footing, no one exerting any undue influence, as traditional casinos universally have.","The blockchain makes gambling much safer - it is impossible for anyone to steal money that players have staked on a bet, or to defraud players by fixing the odds. The same way that one would look into the details of a cryptocurrency transaction, one can look into the details of a bet or a game, to ensure that everything is legitimate, random, reliable, and free of cheating.","What all of this comes down to is simple – we are on the cusp of a revolution in gambling. Blockchain technology can set gambling free from the fraud and oligopolies that have hindered its growth and development. The only way to do that is to take a step back. Rather than competing with the gambling companies, the solution must replace them altogether, passing up on the massive profits they have been able to take for themselves, by “leaving all that money on the table,”.","This is precisely what DezBet will achieve."]}],[{"i":"2-introducing--dezbet","l":"2. Introducing – DezBet","p":["DezBet is not just another gambling company. Our intent is not to start an organisation or a platform through which we will act as a house. In fact, we are stepping away from that role completely. A blockchain protocol is being developed that will enable players to match up directly with one another. In this way, all DezBet users will be on an equal footing. DezBet does not have a central authority controlling its actions.","Using a cost-effective, highly efficient blockchain – to be announced – we are making it affordable for our players to execute smart contracts that create and manage the games between themselves. Dezbet neither takes a share of the gambling profits, nor engages in any gambling rounds. We merely provide the smart contracts and the means to process them and charge a simple fee for hosting games.","As a decentralised gambling protocol, DezBet is not the enemy in the way that traditional casinos and blockchain gambling platforms are. We are on the players' side, providing all of our users with the same fair chance at winning against each other. We are strictly on the outside of every bet. This is so that the players can take on all of the risk and partake in all of the winnings. A secure, transparent P2P protocol for games of chance and skill, DezBet will carry gambling into the modern era. We are shaking off the limitations of traditional gambling. We equip players with the tools to examine, test, and verify any game at any time."]}],[{"l":"3. Market Analysis","p":["DezBet presents a thrilling innovation because there is nothing quite like our platform available on the market today. We are engineering something that is completely unique in the gambling industry. Most entrepreneurs and corporations that enter the gambling industry do so to make a profit. They launch their companies and their platforms because they have seen what other companies have been able to do, in terms of profitability and growth. DezBet will take only nominal fees from every round that it serves, rather than the major winnings that the house traditionally takes from the players.","Worldwide online gambling alone has grown to more than $59 billion in size. This however does not tell the whole story. As the CAGR equals 10%, experts have projected online gambling to nearly double over the next four years, to more than $100 billion by 2026 It is no wonder, then, that there are so many businesses competing over players and their money.","There are conventional gambling solutions, for example. These include Winstar, Casino di Campione, Euromillions, and the huge casinos that corporations like MGM and Caesars have built in Las Vegas and Macau. There are also casinos outside regular jurisdictions, on international bodies of water. These casinos operate with the most impunity, knowing that their players represent captive audiences.","Then there are conventional online platforms, such as Casino777.ch, 888casino.com, Casino.com, Jackpot.ch, and DraftKings.com. These platforms encompass large components for slots, table games, and sports betting, generating tremendous amounts of revenue for their owners. Their odds will vary, but by and large, they are operating with the intent similar to the conventional casinos, taking the vast majority of their players' funds.","Cryptocurrency-based casinos, although offering some promise relative to conventional casinos in-person and online, have nonetheless done little to push back on the high-risk-low-reward business model that has proliferated in the gambling industry. These include Stake.com, Bc.game, Wolf.bet, Bets.io, Rocketpot.io, fortunejack.com, and Trustdice.win. For some time, these have appeared to be the best alternative to conventional casinos. More recently, platforms such as Earnbet.io, Ridotto.io, and Herbet.io have pointed to another possibility though – of a total overhaul for the gambling industry.","However, they have not gone far enough. This is what sets DezBet apart: We are developing an independent, secure gambling protocol that connects players directly to each other.

We are not involved in any way other than facilitating transparent, fair, lucrative gambling, through true decentralization."]}],[{"l":"4. DezBet","p":["DezBet will, over time, support any game that conventional casinos and gambling platforms support. We will host a wide variety of slots, table games, lotteries, and more. To start, we will focus on the games that are already most popular, developing a handful of our own games as well, in order to attract players who are looking for something new and unique. Note that because we are taking on none of the risk associated with the bets, there is never any possibility that DezBet will encounter liquidity problems. We are not taking any of the funds that become winnings for the players. Instead we connect players P2P meaning they act as their own bank generating on demand liquidity.","To get started, players simply initiate a game on the blockchain. They make an initial request to the network, while the game initiates the functions required, such as the verifiable randomness function (VRF). While processing the game, DezBet will refer to a data feed known as an oracle. This is the trusted source of information that communicates the outcome of the game so that the smart contracts can be executed based on the external conditions of the game."]}],[{"l":"5. Game Concepts","p":["Time-based game which allows any number of players to join. It is based around an unbounded address pool which stores the addresses of participants.","Each participant can enter the game by sending a designated amount of gas coins to the contract. After the timer expires, the job scheduler will call the winner-picking function, which in turn queries the VRF to get a random number. Modulo of this number will determine the winner, who takes all the collected funds within the contract, minus the platform fees.","This is another medium-paced game. The chance of winning: \\frac{y}{x}, where x is the total jackpot value and y is the bet value, and the winnings will be the sum of all jackpot entries. It will function similarly to other jackpot games and progressive slot machines, enabling the player to win NFTs of both high and low values. The player will choose the number of NFTs or units to bet – the value staked determining the value that is available to win – and a VRF to initiate the game. The VRF selects the winner. Players' odds remain the same, however, not changing with the amount of the bet. The entire jackpot is available to win at any time.","This is a fast-paced game. The chance of winning: P(ChosenSide) = P(CS) = \\frac{1}{2} = 50\\%, and the winnings will total 2x of the amount bet. It is a familiar game, played by two people, in which each player gets one half of the odds. The VRF then chooses the winning half of the bet. It is a winner-take-all game.","This is a medium-paced game. The chance of winning is \\frac{16!}{(16-5)!} , \\frac{24!}{(24-5)!}, 5\\frac{32!}{(32-5)!}, and the winning total is the sum of the entries. Unlike other lotteries, which take place on a schedule, this lottery will take place whenever the first player buys a ticket. The contract then begins a timer, after which the VRF will determine the winner. Because there is no lottery authority, the winner gets everything, minus the nominal DezBet fee. If no one wins the jackpot, then it rolls over into the next lottery."]}],[{"l":"6. Security","p":["We are aware that players will be wary of trying something new, and therefore we are taking safety and security very seriously. The truth about security and safety in conventional casinos is this: it is an illusion. Even though you may see guards throwing out the rowdier players, the reality is that those guards work for the casino, not for you and not for the other players. When you are in a conventional casino or gambling online through a centralized platform, you are at the mercy of the authorities.","DezBet is different in this way because we are decentralizing gambling and putting all games out into the open. Rather than depending on someone to employ guards, players on DezBet will be able to count on the trustless security trustless} of the blockchain. Fully independent of any central authorities, DezBet acts as a protocol that anyone can verify at any time. If you have any doubts about the outcome of a game, you can look into the process that the protocol has followed, checking in on the blockchain yourself.","All VRFs and oracles on DezBet will be open to the public. There will be no aspect of this protocol that is hidden from view. Because our smart contracts are running automatically, without any manual checks, then it is impossible for our developers or anyone else to interfere in them. The code that we use to write the smart contracts will be open source, as well as independently examined by experts and professionals before we deploy them.","Security and safety are top concerns for DezBet. Freed from the limitations of advertising and promotion, we are able to focus entirely on the DezBet protocol. We will use cutting-edge innovations, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), in order to make our protocol impervious to even the most sophisticated attacks, budgeting a sizable portion of our revenue for ongoing research. On top of that we are going to educate our players, taking the initiative to eliminate or at least reduce the most prevalent issue in any blockchain protocol: human error."]}],[{"l":"7.

The gambling industry - A brief history","p":["Gambling has taken place, in some form or other, for hundreds if not thousands of years, and is inextricably linked to the history of humanity. From ancient China where indications of rudimentary games of chance were discovered on tiles, to Egypt where the oldest known dice were excavated, to scenes on Greek and Roman pottery, humans love to gamble and do so at every opportunity. Around 200 BC „white pigeon ticket“ was played in gambling houses of China with the permission of the province governor, who would receive a percentage of the profits, and the winnings were used to fund state works; Even Harvard and Yale were both initially funded using lottery money, which they continue to use today. As gambling spread throughout society it became more organized and regulated.","The mechanization of gambling meant that winnings could then be regulated more accurately. Today, one of the oldest industries in the world, has become one of the most strictly regulated ones. The ownership of casino entertainment facilities have become subject to pervasive regulations under the laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Gaming laws are based upon declarations of public policy designed to ensure that gaming is conducted honestly, competitively and free of criminal and corruptive elements. Since the continued growth and success of gaming is dependent upon public confidence, gaming laws protect gaming consumers and the integrity and vitality of the gaming industry, including prevention of fraudulent practices. Gaming laws are also designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxation and licensing fees imposed on gaming industry participants and enhance economic development and tourism.","To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws have established many procedures to ensure that participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character, fitness or suitability. These far-reaching and decisive government regulations around the world have forced the casino industry into long-term stagnation and massively impaired growth. This, now narrowed role of the casino, has stimulated innovation and ideas, which is why casinos are facing an unprecedented leap in development - a profound digitalisation and decentralisation of gaming transactions."]}],[{"i":"3-the-future---gambling-on-the-blockchain","l":"3. The Future - Gambling on the Blockchain","p":["Blockchain technology and the emergence of cryptocurrencies is disrupting the gambling industry in ways even experts could not have imagined. Using cryptocurrencies for gambling is becoming widely popular for casinos and can be used either as the main payment system, or as an alternative to fiat-based payment systems. The blockchain provides transaction transparency, reduced house edge and lowers transaction costs. The Blockchain also allows the user to gamble transparently and with the highest level of privacy, almost instantaneous withdrawal and deposit times, with no need to hand over copies of documents or even create an account. Blockchain technology brings this same attributes to gambling, allowing anyone to be a member of the casino. Although some Bitcoin casinos allow users to fund the casinos and profit from a share of the house edge, these concepts have been taken to the next level by other crypto platforms, where projects have created a system where token holders receive dividends from the profits generated by the platform.","Developments in this space are likely to grow rapidly, with teams of developers introducing opportunities for gambling utilizing blockchain technology.

Europe represents the most prominent current market, with Northern America growing the fastest, explained by recent legalisation efforts within the US and Canada. iGaming saw its most recent boom during the COVID-19 pandemic. The temporary closure of physical venues redirected most consumers to the online environment. The influx of new users brought in considerably more revenue and changed the dynamic of gambling globally. This recent popularity was doubled by a move towards the mobile environment, with many essential operators developing dedicated apps and platforms for handheld devices. The Gambling Commission reports that mobile devices have become the most popular means of accessing online casinos and betting services, with around 50% of users using smartphones for this. Online gambling also adopts several emerging technologies to ensure steady growth and ongoing attraction towards the online consumer.","The e-sports scene saw an early adoption, with multiple betting services now providing staking options. Virtual sports are a similar option, but one that has a long history within the online gambling industry. Within the same vein, bookmakers started providing extended functionalities, including social betting, transfers between players and various player-to-player systems.
