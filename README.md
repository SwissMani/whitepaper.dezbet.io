# Welcome

Welcome to the DezBet **Docs** And **WhitePaper**.

The gambling industry has been around for a long time. Those who have experienced it can vouch that
at one point or another, thoughts about rigged games and unfair playing conditions were muddying
up their thoughts. In situations such as this one, the virtues of on-chain implementations of monetary
protocols cannot be overstated. Approaching this industry from a fresh, decentralized standpoint
allows everyone to be equal. The house cannot always win, if there is no house. One could argue that
we are all just addresses on the blockchain which spans across the globe. DezBet aims to provide a inexpensive, transparent and open source protocol, which will provide entertainment to anyone with a pair of private keys and an internet connection. Times are changing, and we must change with them.
