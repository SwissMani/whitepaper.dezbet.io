# 9. The Future of DezBet

In one month in 2021, Las Vegas generated $794 million in revenue from gambling
alone.[4] That was a record at the time, but it will not stand forever. Year after
year, corporations and conglomerates take advantage of their position in the gambling
industry, draining players’ pockets. The status quo would not persist in any other
industry. Still, there has seemed to be no way around this predatory business model.
DezBet offers something superior to the status quo. We are opening the door to
fairer, more transparent gambling for all. Due to bylaws and regulations, we will launch
DezBet without any actual cryptocurrency, enabling players to use numbers and points
during our test phase. From there, we will acquire our gambling licence – and then
move to make our protocol available internationally.
All of this begins with you. We are putting together a community of people who
are ready for a drastic change in the gambling industry. With DezBet, the players are
in control.
