# 7. Tokenomics

Our primary focus, in creating our own token, is to make the DezBet protocol viable. It will provide the players with the simplest, most straightforward means to start gambling with each other. No player, however, needs to obtain our token in order to play our games, aside from specially-marked, DezBet Token-only games, which will also pay out in well-established coins such as ETH, BTC, SOL, and XMR.
 
The main benefit of DezBet Token will be a significant cost reduction for players, reducing fees by a substantial amount. Any cryptocurrency will be compatible with our platform, though. There will be several ways for players to get our token, if they so choose. They can buy it with fiat currency through our website, or they can swap it with another cryptocurrency.
 
In order to initially distribute DezBet Tokens, we will make an initial Exchange offering (IEO), followed by a secondary offering according to demand. The funds that we raise through this IEO will pay for marketing, compliance as well as developer and team salaries. We will also set aside some of these funds to build up the DezBet community, organising meetings and conventions for our team and our token holders. After the IEO, we will actively work on getting DezBet Tokens onto most renowned centralized and decentralized exchanges.
 
DezBet will follow these tokenomics.

Max Total Supply | 512,000,000 Tokens
---    | ---
Max Tokens Allocated for the Initial Offering | 260,000,000 Tokens
IDO/IEO 1 Token planed Price | $0.05
IDO/IEO 1 Total allocated Tokens | 150,000,000 Tokens (hard cap) (57.7% of allocated Offering Tokens)
IDO/IEO 1 Soft Cap | $750,000 (15,000,000 Tokens)
IDO/IEO 1 Hard Cap | $7,500,000 (150,000,000 Tokens)

!!!
At this point, there are multiple directions that DezBet will take.
!!!

=== Scenario A
The hard cap of IDO/IEO 1 is reached,  then the ISPO Phase will be initialised.
=== Scenario B
The soft cap of IDO/IEO 1 is reached, but < 80% of the IDO/IEO 1 hard
cap. In this case, the remaining allocated tokens will be burned, deflating the
total supply
===
=== Scenario C 
The soft cap of IDO/IEO 1 is reached and more than 80%, of the hard cap. Then,
there will be a Tokenholder Exclusive Vote, asking whether or not the ISPO
Phase should be launched. If the vote is against, then the outcome is the same
as in [Scenario B]
=== Scenario D
The Soft Cap of IDO/IEO 1 is not fully reached. In this case, all of the invested funds will be refunded.
===
=== Scenario E
The Hard Cap of the ISPO is reached. All of the allocated tokens have been sold, and the project is at its maximum funding.
=== Scenario F
The HardCap of IDO/IEO 2 isn't fully reached, meaning all of the remaining unsold allocated tokens will be burned, deflating the total supply.
===
