# 1. Blockchain and Gambling Today

Gambling, one of the world's oldest industries, also remains one of the most strictly regulated. Few other industries have faced the restrictions or the stigmas that have prevented gambling from expanding to the degree that it otherwise would. In many countries, online gambling is still a matter of debate. Powerful corporations have worked to keep the business confined in the United States and China, knowing that without the impediments their local laws put on the business, they would not be able to drive the profits they have driven or operate with the impunity they have.
 
Blockchain offers something that none of us have ever seen before: a way forward, out of the punitive and restrictive laws that have affected gambling for such a long time. For the first time ever, it is possible to envision a gambling industry that is substantially more independent from the corporations and the legislators who have protected it. We can picture a gambling industry that works outside of all that negative influence, putting the players in control of their experiences.
 
The decentralisation that blockchain facilitates enables blockchain gambling to function without any central authorities. There is no need for a “house,” because blockchain technology handles all of those roles. Fairness and transparency is guaranteed through decentralised processing, eliminating the need for dealers who are employed by and work for gambling companies. Everyone involved in a round or a game is on an equal footing, no one exerting any undue influence, as traditional casinos universally have.
 
The blockchain makes gambling much safer - it is impossible for anyone to steal money that players have staked on a bet, or to defraud players by fixing the odds. The same way that one would look into the details of a cryptocurrency transaction, one can look into the details of a bet or a game, to ensure that everything is legitimate, random, reliable, and free of cheating.
 
What all of this comes down to is simple – we are on the cusp of a revolution in gambling. Blockchain technology can set gambling free from the fraud and oligopolies that have hindered its growth and development. The only way to do that is to take a step back. Rather than competing with the gambling companies, the solution must replace them altogether, passing up on the massive profits they have been able to take for themselves, by “leaving all that money on the table,”.

This is precisely what DezBet will achieve.
