# 6. Security

We are aware that players will be wary of trying something new, and therefore we are taking safety and security very seriously. The truth about security and safety in conventional casinos is this: it is an illusion. Even though you may see guards throwing out the rowdier players, the reality is that those guards work for the casino, not for you and not for the other players. When you are in a conventional casino or gambling online through a centralized platform, you are at the mercy of the authorities.
 
DezBet is different in this way because we are decentralizing gambling and putting all games out into the open. Rather than depending on someone to employ guards, players on DezBet will be able to count on the trustless security $\cite{trustless}$ of the blockchain. Fully independent of any central authorities, DezBet acts as a protocol that anyone can verify at any time. If you have any doubts about the outcome of a game, you can look into the process that the protocol has followed, checking in on the blockchain yourself.
 
All VRFs and oracles on DezBet will be open to the public. There will be no aspect of this protocol that is hidden from view. Because our smart contracts are running automatically, without any manual checks, then it is impossible for our developers or anyone else to interfere in them. The code that we use to write the smart contracts will be open source, as well as independently examined by experts and professionals before we deploy them.
 
Security and safety are top concerns for DezBet. Freed from the limitations of advertising and promotion, we are able to focus entirely on the DezBet protocol. We will use cutting-edge innovations, including machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), in order to make our protocol impervious to even the most sophisticated attacks, budgeting a sizable portion of our revenue for ongoing research. On top of that we are going to educate our players, taking the initiative to eliminate or at least reduce the most prevalent issue in any blockchain protocol: human error.
