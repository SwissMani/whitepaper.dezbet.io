# 4. DezBet

DezBet will, over time, support any game that conventional casinos and gambling
platforms support. We will host a wide variety of slots, table games, lotteries, and more.
To start, we will focus on the games that are already most popular, developing a handful
of our own games as well, in order to attract players who are looking for something
new and unique. Note that because we are taking on none of the risk associated with
the bets, there is never any possibility that DezBet will encounter liquidity problems.
We are not taking any of the funds that become winnings for the players. Instead
we connect players P2P meaning they act as their own bank generating on demand
liquidity.
To get started, players simply initiate a game on the blockchain. They make an
initial request to the network, while the game initiates the functions required, such
as the verifiable randomness function (VRF). While processing the game, DezBet will
refer to a data feed known as an oracle. This is the trusted source of information that
communicates the outcome of the game so that the smart contracts can be executed
based on the external conditions of the game.
