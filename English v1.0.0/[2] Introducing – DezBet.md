# 2. Introducing – DezBet

DezBet is not just another gambling company. Our intent is not to start an organisation or a platform through which we will act as a house. In fact, we are stepping away from that role completely. A blockchain protocol is being developed that will enable players to match up directly with one another. In this way, all DezBet users will be on an equal footing. DezBet does not have a central authority controlling its actions.
 
Using a cost-effective, highly efficient blockchain – to be announced – we are making it affordable for our players to execute smart contracts that create and manage the games between themselves. Dezbet neither takes a share of the gambling profits, nor engages in any gambling rounds. We merely provide the smart contracts and the means to process them and charge a simple fee for hosting games.
 
As a decentralised gambling protocol, DezBet is not the enemy in the way that traditional casinos and blockchain gambling platforms are. We are on the players' side, providing all of our users with the same fair chance at winning against each other. We are strictly on the outside of every bet. This is so that the players can take on all of the risk and partake in all of the winnings. A secure, transparent P2P protocol for games of chance and skill, DezBet will carry gambling into the modern era. We are shaking off the limitations of traditional gambling. We equip players with the tools to examine, test, and verify any game at any time.
