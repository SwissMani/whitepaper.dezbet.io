# 3. Market Analysis

DezBet presents a thrilling innovation because there is nothing quite like our platform available on the market today. We are engineering something that is completely unique in the gambling industry. Most entrepreneurs and corporations that enter the gambling industry do so to make a profit. They launch their companies and their platforms because they have seen what other companies have been able to do, in terms of profitability and growth. DezBet will take only nominal fees from every round that it serves, rather than the major winnings that the house traditionally takes from the players.
 
Worldwide online gambling alone has grown to more than $59 billion in size. 
This however does not tell the whole story. As the CAGR equals 10%, experts have projected online gambling to nearly double over the next four years, to more than $100 billion by 2026 It is no wonder, then, that there are so many businesses competing over players and their money.

There are conventional gambling solutions, for example. These include Winstar, Casino di Campione, Euromillions, and the huge casinos that corporations like MGM and Caesars have built in Las Vegas and Macau. There are also casinos outside regular jurisdictions, on international bodies of water. These casinos operate with the most impunity, knowing that their players represent captive audiences.
 
Then there are conventional online platforms, such as Casino777.ch, 888casino.com, Casino.com, Jackpot.ch, and DraftKings.com. These platforms encompass large components for slots, table games, and sports betting, generating tremendous amounts of revenue for their owners. Their odds will vary, but by and large, they are operating with the intent similar to the conventional casinos, taking the vast majority of their players' funds.
 
Cryptocurrency-based casinos, although offering some promise relative to conventional casinos in-person and online, have nonetheless done little to push back on the high-risk-low-reward business model that has proliferated in the gambling industry. These include Stake.com, Bc.game, Wolf.bet, Bets.io, Rocketpot.io, fortunejack.com, and Trustdice.win. For some time, these have appeared to be the best alternative to conventional casinos. More recently, platforms such as Earnbet.io, Ridotto.io, and Herbet.io have pointed to another possibility though â€“ of a total overhaul for the gambling industry.
 

However, they have not gone far enough. This is  what sets DezBet apart: We are developing an independent, secure gambling protocol that connects players directly to each other. We are not involved in any way other than facilitating transparent, fair, lucrative gambling, through true decentralization.
