# 3. The Future - Gambling on the Blockchain 

Blockchain technology and the emergence of cryptocurrencies is disrupting the gambling 
industry in ways even experts could not have imagined. Using cryptocurrencies for gambling is becoming 
widely popular for casinos and can be used either as the main payment system, or as an alternative to 
fiat-based payment systems. The blockchain provides transaction transparency, reduced house edge 
and lowers transaction costs. The Blockchain also allows the user to gamble transparently and with 
the highest level of privacy, almost instantaneous withdrawal and deposit times, with no need to 
hand over copies of documents or even create an account. Blockchain technology brings this same 
attributes to gambling, allowing anyone to be a member of the casino. Although some Bitcoin casinos 
allow users to fund the casinos and profit from a share of the house edge, these concepts have been taken 
to the next level by other crypto platforms, where projects have created a system where token holders 
receive dividends from the profits generated by the platform.

Developments in this space are likely to grow rapidly, with teams of developers introducing opportunities 
for gambling utilizing blockchain technology. The most recent development: DezBet, a blockchain based 
gaming ecosystem that offers gambling applications with zero-house edge, competitive platform fees 
and true random numbers from the Chainlink VRF Oracle.
