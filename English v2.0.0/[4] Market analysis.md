# 4. Market Analysis

In 2020 the global iGaming market accrued USD 66.9 billion in revenues, with projections indicating
that it will rise to USD 93 billion in 2023. The industry shows a significant growth rate of a little 
under 11.5% a year. Naturally such a high-valued online market that greatly hinges on constant monetary
transfers for the intention of wagering attract ideas related to cryptocurrency transactions and 
blockchain functionalities. 
 
iGaming is on an unprecedented upswing, with a compound annual growth rate of 11.49%, which 
is set to exceed the USD 100 billion mark by 2026. The industry is best developed in the northern 
hemisphere, with global market sizes reflecting current economic divisions around the globe. Europe 
represents the most prominent current market, with Northern America growing the fastest, explained 
by recent legalisation efforts within the US and Canada. iGaming saw its most recent boom during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. The temporary closure of physical venues redirected most consumers to the 
online environment. The influx of new users brought in considerably more revenue and changed the 
dynamic of gambling globally. This recent popularity was doubled by a move towards the mobile 
environment, with many essential operators developing dedicated apps and platforms for handheld 
devices. The Gambling Commission reports that mobile devices have become the most popular 
means of accessing online casinos and betting services, with around 50% of users using smartphones for 
this. Online gambling also adopts several emerging technologies to ensure steady growth and ongoing 
attraction towards the online consumer. 
 

The e-sports scene saw an early adoption, with multiple betting services now providing staking 
options. Virtual sports are a similar option, but one that has a long history within the online gambling 
industry. Within the same vein, bookmakers started providing extended functionalities, including social
betting, transfers between players and various player-to-player systems. The social aspect of gambling 
has become a key concept. One of the newest changes to the iGaming environment is the entry of
cryptocurrency transactions onto platforms. This aspect creates some of the most remarkable 
changes to gambling sites and their potential future.
