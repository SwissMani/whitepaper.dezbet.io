# 8. Tokenomics

The DZBT Token is a utility token. Certain games on the platform can only be played using the token 
as a means of payment. The DZBT Token is based on the BNB Smart Chain Newtwork.

Max Total Supply | 512,000,000 Tokens
---    | ---
Team & Advisors |  51,200,000 $DZBT
Seed Investors | 51,200,000 $DZBT
Marketing & Incentives | 76,800,000 $DZBT
Treasury  | 25,600,000 $DZBT
Liquidity DEX/CEX | 51,200,000 $DZBT
IEO | 153,600,000 $DZBT
ISPO | 102,400,000 $DZBT

To distribute the DezBet tokens, we will first conduct an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), followed by a Secondary Offering (ISPO), depending on demand. 

!!!
At this point, there are multiple directions that DezBet will take.
!!!

=== Scenario A
The hard cap of IDO/IEO 1 is reached,  then the ISPO Phase will be initialised.
=== Scenario B
The soft cap of IDO/IEO 1 is reached, but < 80% of the IDO/IEO 1 hard
cap. In this case, the remaining allocated tokens will be burned, deflating the
total supply
===
=== Scenario C 
The soft cap of IDO/IEO 1 is reached and more than 80%, of the hard cap. Then,
there will be a Tokenholder Exclusive Vote, asking whether or not the ISPO
Phase should be launched. If the vote is against, then the outcome is the same
as in [Scenario B]
=== Scenario D
The Soft Cap of IDO/IEO 1 is not fully reached. In this case, all of the invested funds will be refunded.
===
=== Scenario E
The Hard Cap of the ISPO is reached. All of the allocated DEZBT have been sold, and the project is at its maximum funding.
=== Scenario F
The HardCap of IDO/IEO 2 isn't fully reached, meaning all of the remaining unsold allocated DZBT will be burned, deflating the total supply.
===

!!!
The vesting period for the tokens is as follows:
