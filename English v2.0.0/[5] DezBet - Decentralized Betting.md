# 5.  DezBet - Decentralized Betting

DezBet is not just another gambling company. Our intent is not to create a company or an online 
platform through which we will act as a house. In fact, we are stepping away from that role 
completely. A blockchain protocol is being developed that will enable players to match up directly with 
one another. This way, all DezBet users will be on an equal footing. Using a cost-effective, highly efficient 
blockchain – to be announced – we are making it affordable for our players to execute smart contracts 
that create and manage the games between one another. Dezbet neither takes a share of the gambling 
profits, nor engages in any gambling rounds. We merely provide the smart contracts and the means 
to process them and charge a simple fee for hosting games. Consequently users don’t have to worry 
about losing money to the house, as the house is not involved in the betting. 
 
As a decentralised gambling protocol, DezBet is not the opponent in the way that traditional casinos and 
blockchain gambling platforms are. We are on the players’ side, providing all of our users with the same 
fair chance at winning against each other. We are strictly on the outside of every bet. This is so that the 
players can take on all of the risk and partake in all of the winnings. A secure, transparent, P2P protocol 
for games of chance, DezBet will carry gambling into the modern era. We are shaking off the limitations 
of traditional casinos. We equip players with the tools to examine, test, and verify any game at any time.

We will use a VRF (Verifiable randomness function) to ensure all of our games are completely up to chance, 
build in measures to completely remove any prospect of fraud and ensure that no one can meddle 
with the odds. Thus users can completely trust the platform.
