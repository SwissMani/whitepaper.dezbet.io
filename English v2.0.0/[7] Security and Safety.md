# 7. Security and Safety

The blockchain technology allows the transaction-recording that users make through cryptocurrencies
such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Additionally, these transactions are maintained by several computers.
This technology has a decentralized network that helps to track cryptocurrency transactions in a public 
ledger. In a single network, the system can record transactions securely on many computers. Due to its 
decentralized structure it promotes security and privacy. Cryptocurrencies are empowering the gambling
industry. Many betting platforms and online casinos are turning to blockchain technology and embracing
its potential. Their empowering qualities include the transparency of gambling records which are now 
difficult to alter. Cryptocurrencies like Ethereum and Bitcoin are precious. Moreover, they are not under
the control of a centralized body like the government. Cryptography records every gambler‘s details and 
ensures that they remain anonymous when transacting in cryptocurrency. Equally important, a public
ledger/ blockchain updates all transactions made by currency holders. Every bitcoin goes directly
to the public ledger which enhances transparency and protects the gamblers. Therefore, a crypto
wallet is essential whilst playing in online casinos so digital tokens can be stored. A play can only 
be started upon transferring a number of bitcoins or any other currency to the player‘s account
 
Before the emergence of blockchain technology, a myriad of challenges has been plaguing the online 
gambling industry. Threats included, but were not limited to, fairness and security. As a result, blockchain 
has proved itself vital. This is because it addresses the problems that gamblers are facing.
 
- **Transparency**
Currently, online casinos are difficult to run as most gamblers lose their bets and 
claim the system is unfair. They accuse the system of setting them up for loss. Also, gambling is 
illegal in some countries. Therefore, financial institutions like banks will not offer gamblers loans. 
Contrary to this, blockchain is open and avails every transaction in the public domain. Therefore, 
everyone can see the winner, or loser, the amount won and whether the winner received the money.

- **Security**

- **Faster Payout Process**
Money withdrawal from the operator‘s account to the player‘s account 
has been a challenge. Bitcoin addresses this well. Transactions involving bitcoin and other cryptos 
usually expel the intermediaries and documents. This simplifies and speeds up the payout process.

- **Anonymity**
Blockchain keeps the gambler‘s information private. Thus preventing the operators 
from identifying players on their platforms. Furthermore, this system is perfect for keeping away 
third parties from accessing the gamblers‘ data.

- **Efficiency and Access** 
Cryptocurrency allows a smooth process by only needing email addresses 
and usernames. Consequently, players are likely to choose online casinos and gambling sites that 
employ cryptocurrency.
