# 1. The gambling industry - A brief history

Gambling has taken place, in some form or other, for hundreds if not thousands of years, and is 
inextricably linked to the history of humanity. From ancient China where indications of rudimentary 
games of chance were discovered on tiles, to Egypt where the oldest known dice were excavated, to 
scenes on Greek and Roman pottery, humans love to gamble and do so at every opportunity. Around 
200 BC „white pigeon ticket“ was played in gambling houses of China with the permission of the 
province governor, who would receive a percentage of the profits, and the winnings were used to 
fund state works; Even Harvard and Yale were both initially funded using lottery money, which they 
continue to use today. As gambling spread throughout society it became more organized and regulated. 
 
The mechanization of gambling meant that winnings could then be regulated more accurately. Today, 
one of the oldest industries in the world, has become one of the most strictly regulated ones. The 
ownership of casino entertainment facilities have become subject to pervasive regulations under the 
laws and regulations of each of the jurisdictions in which they operate. Gaming laws are based upon 
declarations of public policy designed to ensure that gaming is conducted honestly, competitively 
and free of criminal and corruptive elements. Since the continued growth and success of gaming is 
dependent upon public confidence, gaming laws protect gaming consumers and the integrity and 
vitality of the gaming industry, including prevention of fraudulent practices. Gaming laws are also 
designed to protect and maximize state and local revenues derived through taxation and licensing fees 
imposed on gaming industry participants and enhance economic development and tourism. 
 
To accomplish these public policy goals, gaming laws have established many procedures to ensure that 
participants in the gaming industry meet certain standards of character, fitness or suitability. These
far-reaching and decisive government regulations around the world have forced the casino
industry into long-term stagnation and massively impaired growth. This, now narrowed role of the 
casino, has stimulated innovation and ideas, which is why casinos are facing an unprecedented leap in 
development - a profound digitalisation and decentralisation of gaming transactions.
